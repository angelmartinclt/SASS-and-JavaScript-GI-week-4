<h1><em>With the new year coming up this is the perfect budget handling application to set yourself up for great money management, built to be best used as a monthly tracker!</em></h1>

Through this application users can insert their income and expenses, which will then reflect the remaining balance allotted. Users can view income and expense history through a list and have updated calculations to accurately manage their finances. For incorrect expenses or updated income there is a convenient  delete button next to list items.
